The Technical Inspection went around for almost 2 hours and the Judges asked us a query on our brake system as we were using a TMC (Tandem Master Cylinder).

The judges not only appreciated our Design but also our Project Management. At Formula Bharat 2017, we had compliance in our wheel assemblies. This year we worked on the same by improving our design and using better design practices.
