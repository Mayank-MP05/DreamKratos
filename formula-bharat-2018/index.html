            <h1>Formula Bharat 2018</h1>
            <p> Formula Bharat 2018 was an enthralling event for us. The event was held at the Kari Motor Speedway in Coimbatore from the 25th Jan to 28th Jan 2018. At Formula Bharat 2018 we participated in 2 events:
                    1) Formula Bharat Combustion– Statics and Dynamics.
                    2) Electric Vehicle Concept Challenge- Statics.</p>

            <p>Formula Bharat 2019 was indeed a historic moment for the team as the team had shifted to an Electric vehicle (E.V) after competing in CV for the past 2 years at Formula Bharat.
                The journey of the team shifting from CV to EV was quite enthralling for all the members associated with the team. During this span, the team managed not only to design the first prototype but also manufactured, tested and validated some important parameters in just 8 months. All that the team left, to be conquered last year had all eyes set on that destiny, i.e. to cross the finish line of endurance.
                Thus, Team Kratos racing electric came up with its first E.V prototype race car 
                ‘THUNDERBLADE V 1.0’

            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p class="half">The day kicked off as we assembled our vehicle and lined up for the Technical Inspection. The Technical Inspection went around for almost 2 hours and the Judges asked us a query on our brake system as we were using a TMC (Tandem Master Cylinder). They asked, “Would our front and rear brake system be dependent or independent circuits?” We then had a few issues with our wire-locking that we had used for the brake disc followed by issues with the scatter shield, firewall sealing, and hose- clamps. With these issues turning up on Day 1, we could not clear our technical inspection.</p>

            <h2>Day 2</h2>
          
            <p class="half">With all the dynamic events lined up on day 3, we were determined to clear the technical inspection on Day 2. Day 2 was the Static Day, the presentation team was all set to showcase their Design, Cost and Business Plan to the panel. We got the Fireblade ready for Cost and Manufacturing event, where the judges evaluate the team’s ability to present and explain BOM, C-BOM and Cost Understanding. The Cost Event went pretty good as the judges gave us a Positive feedback.</p>
            <p class="full">The Business Plan Presentation was to follow, an event where the B-plan team has to demonstrate how their product can become an effective business model. The Judges are considered as your potential investors/ partners and you are expected to present your business case presentation. They highlighted our good knowledge of finances and the perfect coordination among the presenters. We cleared the Tech Inspection just after the Business Plan Presentation. We were among the Top 4 teams to clear the Technical Inspection. The Fireblade was then taken for the Tilt test (the vehicle is inclined at an angle of 60 degrees). After clearing the Tilt, Fireblade cleared the Noise Test (108dB). The Design team was all set as they approached the design bay to present before Pat Clarke. The judges not only appreciated our Design but also our Project Management. At Formula Bharat 2017, we had compliance in our wheel assemblies. This year we worked on the same by improving our design and using better design practices.</p>

            <p class="half"> This year at Formula Bharat we had almost nil compliance in our wheel assemblies and the judges were satisfied with that. The last sticker of clearing the Brakes test gave our Fireblade its final touch.</p>

                    The whole team was indeed pumped as it looked to give out their best in the static events.
                    The team lined up for Mechanical scrutineering as soon as the bay got open and got all the three stickers of Accumulator, electrical and mechanical inspection in the morning.
           Followed by the technical inspection, the team had no time to waste as the car went into the design bay for the design presentations scheduled at 10 am.
