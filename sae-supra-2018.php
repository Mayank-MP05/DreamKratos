								<p>And the Day 1 of SAE Supra started with teams rushing to line up their vehicle for the Technical Inspection. Fortunately, there were total 8 bays for the Technical Inspection. So there was a smooth movement for the Technical Inspection. The first attempt of the Technical Inspection for all the teams went long as the Judges went on with a detailed safety check of the vehicle. It took almost an hour for the teams who entered the TI bay for their first attempt. In our first attempt, we had a few changes coming in from the judges.

								<h3>the Rush </h3>
								<p>A new day, but still loads of work on our Beast as it needed to be ready for the Tilt, Noise and Brakes Test respectively.

									Usually, as we knew and had a bit of experience from our previous events, the team was expecting to clear all the remaining tests by afternoon.

									But the Tilt Test itself proved to be slightly odd as we did not clear it in the First attempt. Tilt judge was trying to rotate the outer wheel which comparatively had the less normal reaction.

									After a few teams had a query about this, the judges finally gave the clearance after reviewing with the officials. The team cleared the tilt test in the afternoon just before lunchtime and were next lined up for the noise test.
									Noise test didn’t face any significant issues and it was cleared in the very first attempt.

									There were some minute things which got overlooked and it did not favor us in the Acceleration event.

									The car didn’t quite have that start which it needed during acceleration and the problem that came in front was small air gaps in the fuel line.

									The fuel line was not primed properly. As we all know, during the shipping of the vehicles, the fuel tanks are totally dry and during the refueling of the vehicle, the fuel line still had some air gaps which caused an overall bad performance at the acceleration event. MISTAKES MADE… LESSONS LEARNT…

									We headed straight back to the crank area and made sure that all the air gaps are fixed.

								<p>
									A shaky but a good start to the dynamic events.

								Just after acceleration, the team got ready for the static events.

                We started with the Cost event.

								Three judges were present at the cost bay. This time, judges were looking for certain pre-requisite materials in the cost report which included zip ties, aluminum tapes, Teflon, etc. Still, judges didn’t enter the costing of the vehicle much but were focussed on design aspects for the major time.

								The team had worked vigorously on its Design Report. Be it from any section, the team always stuck to one thing that is reliability when it came to Design Considerations

									Innovations never lacked in any system. Take it from brakes where advanced topics like Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was validated to the composites system where carbon fiber was coming in use with the dome, side pods, steering wheel and the track rods manufactured and analyzed in our very innovation center. Even the Data Acquisition System(DAQ) took a major leap by introducing telemetry which recorded various on-track live data. Judges were quite impressed by our efforts put in each system. Thus we had significantly more time explaining our engineering concepts that we applied in the car to all the gathered esteemed judges.

								<p>It was just one day before the final day, and all eyes were set on the autocross.

									Drivers usually would get to test the vehicle in test area once in a day.
									
									The team went into the testing area around 10 am in morning. Got the tires warm and lined up Quickly for the Autocross.
									
									If you would take a closer look at the autocross track, it had too much of gravel which resulted in uncontrolled feedback to the driver in some patches. Plus the track had tricky cone markings which left most of the drivers confused.
