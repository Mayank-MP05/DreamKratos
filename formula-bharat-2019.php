						<p style="text-align: center">What’s in the name?  Well, It’s the event which comes once in a year for across 100+ teams in India who are very much excited to showcase their talent in every possible way. In other words, it’s a dream destination for upcoming engineers to Design, Develop and test a Formula 3 type race car prototype.

							Formula Bharat since then has been a platform for every aspiring engineer and with the course of time, Formula Bharat, this year organized its First ever ‘EV’ category for teams. Formula Bharat 2019 witnessed across 120 teams competing in CV whereas 19 teams competing in ‘EV’.
							
							Formula Bharat 2019 was indeed a historic moment for the team as the team had shifted to an Electric vehicle (E.V) after competing in CV for the past 2 years at Formula Bharat.

							<br><br>	The journey of the team shifting from CV to EV was quite enthralling for all the members associated with the team. During this span, the team managed not only to design the first prototype but also manufactured, tested and validated some important parameters in just 8 months. All that the team left, to be conquered last year had all eyes set on that destiny, i.e. to cross the finish line of endurance.

							Thus, Team Kratos racing electric came up with its first E.V prototype race car

									The team lined up for Mechanical scrutineering as soon as the bay got open and got all the three stickers of Accumulator, electrical and mechanical inspection in the morning.
				 
									Followed by the technical inspection, the team had no time to waste as the car went into the design bay for the design presentations scheduled at 10 am.</p>

								<h3>Q and A</h3>
								<p>Right after the design presentation was the cost and manufacturing event from 11 am to 12 noon. Cost and manufacturing event started with the judges having a look at the vehicle and asking questions related to the BOM. Right after BOM judges asked some questions about CBOM of chassis and body works and tested the manufacturing knowledge and depth of understanding of various manufacturing process. Followed by CBOM judges asked a few points about cost understanding before concluding the session. Cost and manufacturing event overall went good with certain areas of improvement such as accuracy of BOM, etc.</p>

The team lined up for brakes and got them cleared in the very first attempt. The team was very happy to complete with the technical inspection and now it was ready for the dynamic events.
				 It was a very proud moment for the team and everyone out there as Thunderblade V 1.0 was ready to go on its wheels for the very first time.
				 By the afternoon the team had done with skidpad with the best timing of 5.8 sec and 6.3 seconds in acceleration.
				here we were the only team who cleared the inspections and attempted the autocross. The whole team was present to see the car take a lap for the first time.

The THUNDERBLADE proved itself, given a belief of all the efforts put in by the students this year as it stood first not only in electric vehicles but also in combustion cars, beating the fastest combustion car by 11secs and creating a benchmark.

									Thunderblade V 1.0 recorded the fastest autocross timing of 1 minute 44 seconds.
				 
				 The day ended with the distribution of statics awards. That day, that moment, our first event objective was achieved as the team bagged a 1st place in Design event followed by a runner-up place in Business plan and 3rd place in Cost and manufacturing. A day to remember before the final day as the team called off the day after charging the accumulator.</p>

The team was already having anxiety along with confidence and yes, it was our turn arrived, leaving everyone in mere awe! Everything just came down to this one moment, where all the hardships and pain was felt. It wasn’t only a chance to prove our worth but also a chance to write a legacy along as the first

Abhishek Patil was our first driver and Shubhaang Digge drove the latter half and every effort, every brainstorming session, all the pain was justified when the THUNDERBLADE crossed the chequered flag and the team broke down in tears, tears of happiness! The track witnessed its first run of an ELECTRIC RACE CAR where the tracks and pits echoed “KRATOS” and “THUNDERBLADE”. Moment of gratification!
